# L27ButtonComboBox
A data enabled ButtonComboBox component for use in Elevate Web Builder 2

This demo creates a sample DataSet at Run-Time in the FormCreate event.

You would normally create it at Design-Time by dropping a dataset from the DataSet Manager and define the component properties there.

Enjoy!
